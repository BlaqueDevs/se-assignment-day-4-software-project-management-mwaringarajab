3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Aspect	Agile	Waterfall
Approach	Iterative & flexible	Linear & structured
Planning	Adaptive & ongoing	Defined upfront
Feedback	Continuous customer feedback	Minimal until the final stage
Risk Management	Better due to frequent iterations	Higher as issues may surface late
Best for	Dynamic projects with evolving requirements	Stable, well-defined projects
4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is best for:

Web and mobile app development (e.g., Instagram feature updates)
Software requiring continuous updates (e.g., SaaS products)
Waterfall is best for:

Large-scale government projects (e.g., military software)
Safety-critical systems (e.g., healthcare software)
5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods:

Automated and manual testing
Code reviews
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
User feedback loops
Importance:

Enhances user satisfaction
Reduces post-deployment errors
Saves costs on bug fixes
6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Project scope: Prevents misunderstandings and keeps the team aligned on deliverables.

WBS (Work Breakdown Structure): A hierarchical breakdown of tasks, helping with:

Resource allocation
Progress tracking
Risk management
7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Benefits:

Clear timeline for deliverables
Efficient resource management
Helps in tracking dependencies
Gantt Charts:

Visual representation of tasks
Shows dependencies between tasks
Helps identify potential bottlenecks
8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Depends on your software idea (e.g., learning platform, fintech, etc.)
Identifies pain points such as inefficiency, lack of automation, or security concerns
9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Ensures focus on key pain points
Helps in choosing the right technology stack
Prevents unnecessary features that bloat development
10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
Example: "A web-based learning platform that makes coding fun and interactive for beginners."

11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Unique selling points (e.g., AI-driven recommendations, real-time collaboration, gamification, etc.)
12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Depends on industry research (e.g., EdTech, FinTech, etc.)
Can use reports from Statista, Gartner, or IBISWorld
13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Helps identify customer needs
Guides pricing strategies
Enables differentiation from competitors
